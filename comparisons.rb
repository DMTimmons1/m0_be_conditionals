# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result.

# One example is already completed. Your task is to complete
# any remaining prompt.

# Make sure to run the file in your command line. Look back
# at the directions from Section 1 if you need a refresher on how to do that.


#-------------------
# PART 1: Comparing variables
#-------------------

number_teachers = 4
number_students = 20
string_teachers = "4"
numberDogs = 0

# EXAMPLE: print the result of the comparison: is number_seachers greater than number_students?
puts "Is number_teachers greater than number_students?", number_teachers > number_students
# this should print: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers less than number_students?
# this should print: true
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_teachers < number_students

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers equal to string_teachers?
# this should print: false
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_teachers == number_students

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers not equal to number_students?
# this should print: true
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_teachers != number_students

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students greater than or equal to 20?
# this should print: true
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_students >= 20

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students greater than or equal to 21?
# this should print: false
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_students >= 21

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students less than or equal to 20?
# this should print: true
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_students <= 20

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students less than or equal to 21?
# this should print: true
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_students <= 21


#-------------------
# PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
#-------------------

# For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
# in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
# Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
# Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

puts 4 < 9
# this code is asking if 4 is less than 9.
# this will print: true because 4 is less than 9.

books = 3
puts 4 < books
# the first line of code defines an integer for the variable 'books' as 3. 
# the next line of code is asking if 4 is smaller than the integer assigned to 'books'.
# this will print: false because 4 is less than 3.

friends = 6
siblings = 2
puts friends > siblings
# the first line of code defines an integer for the variable 'friends' as 6.
# the next line of code defines an ineger for the variable 'siblings' as 2.
# the third line of code is asking if the integer assinged to 'friends' is greater than the integer assigned to 'siblings'.
# this will print: true because 6 is greater than 2.

attendees = 9
meals = 8
puts attendees != meals
# the first line of code defines an integer for the variable 'attendees' as 9.
# the next line of code defines an ineger for the variable 'meals' as 8.
# the third line of code is asking if the integer assigned to 'atendees' is not equal to the integer assgined to 'meals'
# this will print: true becasue 9 is not equal to 8.

#-------------------
# PART 3: Logical Operators
#-------------------

is_hungry = true
finished_homework = false

# EXAMPLE:
# Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
puts is_hungry && finished_homework
# Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
puts is_hungry || finished_homework

loves_to_play = true
loves_dog_park = false
loves_treats = true
age = 1

# YOU DO:
# Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
puts loves_to_play && loves_treats

# Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
puts loves_to_play && loves_dog_park

# Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
puts loves_to_play || loves_dog_park

# Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
puts loves_to_play && age <= 1

# What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
# ANSWER: the final line of code evaluates to true. This is becasue the boolean assigned to the dog loving to play is true and the integer assigned to the dog's age is less than or greater to 1. 
# this prints true becasuse the values assigned to the variables satisfy the parameters given.
