# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  - I feel pretty confident with comparison operators. It's just comparing two values to get a true or false statement.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  - I feel pretty confident with logical operators. We're Basically taking two or more variables and getting an evaluation based on if their values meet the conditions.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  - I feel confident in my understanding of if statments the most. There's multiple if statements you can have depending on how many conditions need to be met for your desired output. Seems like this is the most versatile is what it can achieve. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  - A little over an hour and a half. I went over than what I expected it would take by about 40 minutes. Since this is my first time doing these i'm not beating myself up too much about it.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - I think I just need to practice knowing all the different operators. I kept running into issues becasue I was puting = instead of ==, which was changiing the value and not an operator. I think I can just take some time during my study/reflection time to make sure I have these down. 

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
 - I don't really have any questions about this at the moment, but as time goes on and I learn more about it I'll have more quesions.
